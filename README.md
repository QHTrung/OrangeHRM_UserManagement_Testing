# OrangeHRM User Management Testing Project

## Overview

This repository documents my practical experience in manual software testing, specifically focusing on the User Management module of the OrangeHRM web application. This project involved a systematic approach to test case design, execution of functional tests, and thorough defect reporting, showcasing my ability to ensure software quality for a real-world HR system.

This project demonstrates my foundational understanding of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) and proficiency in applying various test design techniques.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project was to develop and execute a comprehensive test case suite for the user management functionalities of the OrangeHRM system, aiming to identify defects and ensure the system operates as expected according to its requirements.

## Application Under Test (AUT)

* **Type:** Web Application (OrangeHRM - Open Source Human Resource Management System)
* **Key Functionalities Tested (User Management Module):**
    * Adding new users (Admin/ESS roles, various statuses)
    * Editing existing user information
    * Deleting/Deactivating user accounts
    * Assigning/Modifying user roles and permissions
    * Searching and filtering user accounts

## My Role & Contributions

As a Manual Tester on this project, my key contributions included:

* **Analyze and explore the functional screens** to understand the key features and workflows involved in user management.
* **Designed and wrote 60+ detailed test cases** for user management functionalities, applying techniques such as Boundary Value Analysis, Equivalence Partitioning, and Error Guessing.
* **Created diverse test data** to ensure comprehensive coverage of valid and invalid scenarios.
* **Executed Functional Testing** on developed test cases, recording results and comparing them against expected outcomes.
* **Identified and reported defects**, providing clear reproduction steps and attaching screenshots/videos.


## Technologies & Tools Used

* **Application Under Test:** OrangeHRM (Web Application)
* **Test Case Management:** Google Sheets
* **Defect Tracking:** Jira
* **Browser Developer Tools:** Chrome Developer Tools (for UI/console inspection).
* **Documentations:** Mindmap for system
